Small SLIM app with sharing template engine between frontend and backend.

Demo here: http://www.robertcasanova.it/micro-tmpl/

The frontend of this App was originally developed by Daniele Marchesini (https://twitter.com/#!/dannymarke)
for a great presentation about micro-templating. Thx Dan. =)
 

This is just a test, don't fork it.

TODO:

* reorganize the file structure
* manage layout/partials with mustache
